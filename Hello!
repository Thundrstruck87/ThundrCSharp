# ThundrCSharp

Thanks for dropping by! In my time of learning C# I am always thinking of side project to do to help me better understand how to code. This repository holds all of my projects
I think of on the side that I wanted to create to help me learn. My next step after each project is to always do better and make the next project more challenging.
